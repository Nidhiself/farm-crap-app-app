# Farm Crap App Pro (iOS)

The Farm Crap App Pro (FCA) is the open-source app that helps to reduce fertiliser use by calculating organic manure nutrients values.

FCA is based on [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and any calculations have been based off of the codebase for the [Android version of FCA](https://github.com/fo-am/crapapppro).
